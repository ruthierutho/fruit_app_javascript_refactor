Fruits of the World version 1.0.1

The brief

Our brief was to create a Minimum Viable Product or prototype which could be put forward to the BBC in order to improve their online offering of educational content.  The idea was to create an interactive browser application that displays information in a fun and interesting way. 

We chose to create an app which we envisaged being used primarily by teachers of 9-12 year-olds, inspired by the ‘BBC Bitesize’ website.  The app teaches children about the biology, origins and nutritional value of different fruits.

The app is designed to be easy to use and engaging for children in this age group.  Whilst primarily aimed at teachers to use as a resource for setting activities or homework for their classes, the app could equally appeal to parents, to provide children with an educational activity which they can carry out independently. 

Running instructions

1. Before running, ensure front-end and server are both set up. For the client side you should enter "npm install" and "npm run serve", and for the server side you should enter "mongod", "npm run seeds" and "npm run server:dev". 

2. Main page lists a grid structure showing various fruits.

3. Clicking on an individual fruit will display information about the selected fruit in a pop-up window.  As well as text detailing facts, there is a map showing the fruit’s origin and a pie chart showing the breakdown of its macros.
